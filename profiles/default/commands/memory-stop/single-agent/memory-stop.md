## Memory Stop - Stop Background Progress Monitoring

This command stops the memory-monitor background service that automatically tracks your project progress.

### What This Does

Stops the memory-monitor service and shows you:
- Final status and statistics
- Recent monitor activity
- When RESTART.md was last updated

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Stop the Monitor

Run this command to stop the service:

```bash
# Stop the memory monitor
$HOME/agent-os/scripts/memory-monitor.sh stop
```

You should see:
```
Memory monitor stopped (PID: 12345)
```

Or if it's not running:
```
Memory monitor is not running
```

#### Step 2: View Final Activity

Check the recent activity:

```bash
# Show last 10 log entries
echo "Recent monitor activity:"
tail -10 .agent-os/memory-monitor.log

# Check when RESTART.md was last updated
echo ""
echo "RESTART.md last modified:"
ls -la RESTART.md | awk '{print $6, $7, $8}'
```

#### Step 3: Verify It Stopped

Confirm the monitor is no longer running:

```bash
# Check for PID file
if [[ -f .agent-os/memory-monitor.pid ]]; then
    echo "Warning: PID file still exists"
else
    echo "✓ Monitor stopped cleanly"
fi
```

#### Step 4: Next Steps

Now that automatic monitoring is stopped, you should:

**Option A: Update manually**
```bash
# Add detailed context to RESTART.md manually
# Use the /memory-update command
```

**Option B: Create checkpoint**
```bash
# Create a progress checkpoint with git commit
# Use the /memory-commit command
```

**Option C: Restart monitor**
```bash
# If you stopped it for troubleshooting, restart it
# Use the /memory-start command
```

### What Happens When You Stop

✓ **Preserved:**
- All RESTART.md updates remain
- Monitor logs in `.agent-os/memory-monitor.log`
- State file in `.agent-os/memory-monitor.state`
- All your work and progress

✗ **Stopped:**
- Background monitoring process
- Automatic RESTART.md updates
- Periodic change detection

### When to Use This

Stop the memory monitor when:
- ✓ Ending your work session
- ✓ Switching to manual updates only
- ✓ Troubleshooting monitor issues
- ✓ Checking monitor status
- ✓ You want to restart it fresh

### Viewing Monitor Logs

To see what the monitor did while it was running:

```bash
# View entire log
cat .agent-os/memory-monitor.log

# View last 20 entries
tail -20 .agent-os/memory-monitor.log

# Search for specific activity
grep "Detected" .agent-os/memory-monitor.log
```

### Common Log Messages

You'll see entries like:
```
[2025-01-15 10:30:00] INFO: Memory monitor started
[2025-01-15 10:35:00] INFO: Detected new commit(s)
[2025-01-15 10:35:01] INFO: Updating RESTART.md...
[2025-01-15 10:35:02] INFO: RESTART.md updated successfully
[2025-01-15 10:40:00] DEBUG: No changes detected, skipping update
```

### After Stopping the Monitor

Remember to:
1. **Update manually** - Run `/memory-update` after significant tasks
2. **Create checkpoints** - Run `/memory-commit` periodically
3. **Shutdown properly** - Run `/agent-os-shutdown` when ending session

Or simply **restart the monitor** if you want automatic tracking:
```bash
# Restart monitoring
# Use /memory-start command
```

### Troubleshooting

**Monitor won't stop:**
```bash
# Force stop
if [[ -f .agent-os/memory-monitor.pid ]]; then
    kill -9 $(cat .agent-os/memory-monitor.pid)
    rm -f .agent-os/memory-monitor.pid
    echo "Monitor force-stopped"
fi
```

**Want to check if it's really stopped:**
```bash
# Check for the process
ps aux | grep memory-monitor.sh | grep -v grep
```

If you see output, it's still running. If no output, it's stopped.

### Files Created by Monitor

The monitor creates these files (safe to keep):
- `.agent-os/memory-monitor.pid` - Process ID (deleted on stop)
- `.agent-os/memory-monitor.log` - Activity log (preserved)
- `.agent-os/memory-monitor.state` - Last known state (preserved)

You can safely delete these files anytime if needed.

**Ready to stop?** Run the command in Step 1 above, then reply "Done" when the monitor is stopped.

**Remember:** After stopping the monitor, you should manually run `/memory-update` to keep RESTART.md current!
